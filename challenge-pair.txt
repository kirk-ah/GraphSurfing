Burt Cockley
Megi Luka

Here's my explanation for how I found this challenge pair...

First, I found the person in the graph with the most successors (Highest out degree). This was Burt Cockley.
Then, I split the set of all keys into 25 sublists of keys. Then I found the shortest path from Burt to all of the keys,
using 25 threads, one for each sublist. This led me to the pair.
